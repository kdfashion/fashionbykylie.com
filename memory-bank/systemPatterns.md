# Fashion By Kylie - System Patterns

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The Fashion By Kylie platform uses a modern frontend architecture based on Next.js with the App Router pattern:

```
src/
├── app/               # App Router structure
│   ├── (shop)/        # Shop-related routes grouped
│   │   ├── products/  # Product catalog and detail pages
│   │   ├── cart/      # Shopping cart functionality
│   │   ├── checkout/  # Checkout process
│   │   └── account/   # User account management
│   ├── about/         # Company information
│   ├── api/           # API routes for frontend-backend communication
│   ├── components/    # Shared UI components
│   ├── lib/           # Utility functions and shared logic
│   ├── styles/        # Global styles and theme configuration
│   └── layout.tsx     # Root layout with common elements
```

### Data Flow Architecture
- **Server Components**: Used for data fetching and initial rendering
- **Client Components**: Used for interactive elements and state management
- **API Routes**: Handle server-side operations and external service integration

## Key Technical Decisions

### Framework Selection
- **Next.js**: Chosen for its server-side rendering capabilities, optimized image handling, and built-in routing
- **React**: Provides component-based architecture for maintainable UI development
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and improves developer experience

### Styling Approach
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for utility-first styling with custom theme configuration
- **CSS Variables**: Implement theme colors and design tokens for consistent styling
- **Component-Specific Styles**: Applied where needed for complex components

### State Management
- **React Context**: For global state like shopping cart and user preferences
- **Server Components**: Leverage React Server Components for data-fetching without client-side state
- **Local Component State**: For UI-specific interactions

### Performance Optimization
- **Image Optimization**: Using Next.js Image component for responsive and optimized images
- **Code Splitting**: Automatic code splitting based on routes
- **Static Generation**: For content that doesn't change frequently
- **Incremental Static Regeneration**: For product pages that need fresh data with good performance

## Design Patterns

### Component Patterns
- **Atomic Design**: Organizing components as atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages
- **Compound Components**: For complex interactive elements with shared state
- **Render Props**: For components that need to share behavior but have different rendering
- **Custom Hooks**: For reusable logic across components

### Data Fetching Patterns
- **Server Components**: Primary method for data fetching
- **SWR/React Query**: For client-side data fetching with caching and revalidation
- **API Routes**: For secure server-side operations

### UI Patterns
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints for larger screens
- **Accessibility Patterns**: ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and semantic HTML
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript, enhanced with client-side features

## Component Relationships

### Layout Components
- **RootLayout**: Provides global structure, fonts, and theme
- **ShopLayout**: Adds shop-specific elements like navigation and cart access
- **ProductLayout**: Specialized layout for product pages with breadcrumbs

### UI Component Hierarchy
```
Page Components
├── Layout Components (structural)
│   ├── Navigation Components
│   ├── Content Components
│   └── Footer Components
├── Feature Components (functional)
│   ├── Product Components
│   ├── Cart Components
│   └── Checkout Components
└── UI Components (presentational)
    ├── Button Components
    ├── Form Components
    └── Display Components
```

### State Relationships
- **User Context**: Manages authentication state and user preferences
- **Cart Context**: Handles shopping cart state across the application
- **UI Context**: Controls global UI state like modals and notifications

## Error Handling Strategy
- **Error Boundaries**: Catch and handle rendering errors
- **Try/Catch Patterns**: For async operations with appropriate fallbacks
- **Error States**: Dedicated UI states for different error scenarios

## Testing Strategy
- **Component Testing**: Unit tests for individual components
- **Integration Testing**: Testing component interactions
- **E2E Testing**: Critical user flows like checkout process
- **Visual Regression**: Ensure UI consistency across changes

## Security Patterns
- **Input Validation**: Both client and server-side validation
- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication flow
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control for admin features
- **Data Protection**: Secure handling of user and payment information

This document will evolve as the system architecture develops and new patterns emerge during implementation.
