# Fashion By Kylie - Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The project is currently in the initial setup phase. We have established the base Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. The current focus is on:

1. Setting up the Memory Bank documentation system
2. Planning the implementation of the core website structure
3. Defining the component architecture and design system
4. Preparing for initial UI development

## Recent Changes

- Created the project using Next.js 15.2.2 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Set up the Memory Bank documentation system with core files:
  - projectbrief.md
  - productContext.md
  - systemPatterns.md
  - techContext.md
  - activeContext.md (this file)
  - progress.md
- Initialized the Git repository
- Configured ESLint for code quality
- Added a "New Designs" section to the homepage featuring:
  - Two showcase images (fashion1.jpeg and fashion2.jpeg)
  - A birthday message celebrating Kylie's 10th birthday
  - Integration with the existing design system

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Replace the default Next.js template with the Fashion By Kylie branding
2. Implement the basic layout structure with header, footer, and main content area
3. Create the design system with brand colors, typography, and UI components
4. Develop the homepage with featured products section

### Short-term Goals
1. Implement product listing page with filtering capabilities
2. Create product detail page template
3. Set up basic navigation structure
4. Implement responsive design for mobile and desktop

### Medium-term Goals
1. Integrate with a headless CMS for product management
2. Implement user authentication system
3. Develop shopping cart functionality
4. Create checkout process

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Design System Implementation
- **Decision Needed**: Whether to use a component library like Shadcn UI or build custom components from scratch
- **Considerations**: 
  - Custom components provide more control over the royal aesthetic
  - Component libraries can speed up development
  - Tailwind CSS provides a good foundation for either approach

### State Management Approach
- **Decision Needed**: How to handle global state for shopping cart and user preferences
- **Considerations**:
  - React Context API is built-in and sufficient for many needs
  - Server Components reduce the need for client-side state management
  - More complex state might benefit from libraries like Zustand or Jotai

### Product Data Management
- **Decision Needed**: Selection of headless CMS for product catalog
- **Considerations**:
  - Need for content editing by non-technical users
  - Image optimization capabilities
  - Integration complexity with Next.js
  - Cost and scalability

### Authentication Strategy
- **Decision Needed**: Implementation approach for user accounts
- **Considerations**:
  - Build custom solution vs. using auth providers
  - Security requirements
  - User experience during sign-up/login
  - Social login integration

### Performance Optimization
- **Decision Needed**: Strategies for meeting performance goals
- **Considerations**:
  - Image optimization for product photos
  - Code splitting and lazy loading
  - Server-side rendering vs. static generation for different page types
  - Caching strategies

## Current Challenges

1. **Brand Implementation**: Translating the "royal elegance" concept into a cohesive digital experience
2. **Performance with Rich Media**: Ensuring fast loading times while showcasing high-quality product images
3. **Mobile Experience**: Creating a premium shopping experience that works well on smaller screens
4. **Technical Complexity**: Balancing feature richness with development timeline

## Team Context

- Project is in initial development phase
- Documentation being established to guide implementation
- Architecture decisions being made to support long-term goals

This document will be regularly updated as the project progresses, decisions are made, and new challenges emerge.
