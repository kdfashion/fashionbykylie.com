# Fashion By Kylie - Project Rules

## Project Patterns

### File Structure
- Use the Next.js App Router structure for all pages
- Place reusable components in `src/app/components/`
- Organize utility functions in `src/app/lib/`
- Store global styles in `src/app/globals.css`
- Keep static assets in the `public/` directory

### Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for React components: `ProductCard.tsx`
- Use camelCase for utility functions and files: `formatPrice.ts`
- Use kebab-case for CSS class names: `product-card`
- Use snake_case for API endpoints: `/api/product_details`

### Component Structure
- Prefer functional components with TypeScript interfaces
- Use named exports for components
- Include prop type definitions for all components
- Group related components in subdirectories

### Styling Approach
- Use Tailwind CSS for component styling
- Define custom theme values in globals.css
- Use CSS variables for theme colors and design tokens
- Maintain the royal aesthetic throughout all UI elements

### State Management
- Use React Context for global state
- Prefer server components for data fetching
- Use client components only when interactivity is needed
- Keep state as local as possible

## Project Preferences

### Code Style
- Follow ESLint rules for code formatting
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize images using Next.js Image component
- Implement code splitting for large components
- Use server components where possible to reduce client-side JavaScript
- Implement proper loading states for async operations

### Accessibility Standards
- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Provide appropriate ARIA attributes
- Maintain sufficient color contrast for text
- Test with screen readers

### Development Workflow
- Create feature branches for new functionality
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Update Memory Bank documentation when making significant changes
- Test on multiple devices before considering work complete

## Project Intelligence

### Brand Guidelines
- Primary color: Gold (#D4AF37)
- Supporting colors: Rich jewel tones and neutrals
- Typography: Premium, elegant fonts
- Visual style: Polished, luxurious, sophisticated

### Key Implementation Paths
- Product catalog is the core of the shopping experience
- Mobile responsiveness is critical for the target audience
- Performance optimization is essential for product images
- Checkout process must be seamless and trustworthy

### Known Challenges
- Balancing royal aesthetic with modern usability
- Optimizing performance while maintaining visual quality
- Creating a cohesive experience across device sizes
- Implementing secure e-commerce functionality
